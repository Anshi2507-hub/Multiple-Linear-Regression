üéØ Objective

Import and preprocess the chosen dataset.
Split the data into train and test sets.
Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
Evaluate the model using MAE, MSE, and R^2 metrics.
Interpret the coefficients and, where applicable, plot the regression line.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries UsedProgramming Language: Python

Environment: Google Colab

Core Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): For model implementation and evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.

üìä Dataset
The House Price Prediction Dataset was used for this project. This dataset provides various features (e.g., area, number of rooms, location) and their corresponding house prices, which serves as a rich source for training the regression model.

üíª Implementation Steps
Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset was loaded, and initial checks were performed for structure and statistics.
Data Pre-processing: Missing values were handled, categorical features were encoded (if necessary), and the appropriate feature set (X) and target variable (y) (House Price) were identified.

Data Splitting: The data was split into a Training Set and a Testing Set (typically 70/30 or 80/20) to ensure robust model evaluation.
Model Training: A LinearRegression model from sklearn.linear_model was instantiated and trained (fitted) on the training data.
Evaluation: Predictions were made on the test set, and the model's performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics.
Interpretation: The learned coefficients were examined to understand the quantitative relationship between each feature and the house price.

üìà Model Performance
The model was evaluated on the test set, and the achieved performance metrics are as follows:
Metric	Value	Interpretation
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	9.7 Lakhs	On average, the model's predictions are 9.7 Lakhs away from the actual house prices. This provides a direct measure of the average error in the original units.
Mean Squared Error (MSE)	1.75 Trillion	This value is significantly large due to squaring the errors. It heavily penalizes larger errors (outliers), making it useful for optimizing models where large errors are undesirable.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	13.2 Lakhs	The square root of the MSE, bringing the error back into the original units, making it comparable to the MAE but still more sensitive to large errors.
R^2 Score (Coefficient of Determination)	0.65	
The model explains 65 of the variability in the target variable (House Price). This suggests a reasonably good fit to the data.

üìù Conclusion
The trained Linear Regression model achieved an R^2 score of 0.65, indicating it successfully captures a significant portion of the variance in house prices. The MAE of 9.7 Lakhs provides a clear, interpretable measure of the model's average prediction error.

Future Scope: To further enhance model performance, techniques such as Feature Scaling, advanced Feature Engineering, and exploring other regression algorithms (like Ridge or Lasso Regression) can be employed.
